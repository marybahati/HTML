<p>People who have pets have free time and wealth. Pets are animals that are kept for pleasure, and they have been tamed and domesticated. A domestic animal has also been tamed, and is kept by humans as a food source, for work, or only for pleasure. Not all domestic animals are pets, though they can be think of a chicken, pig, or a cow. And not all tame animals are domestic animals, elephant or a tiger, for instance.</p>


<p>The archaeological and genetic record is being combed and analyzed for evidence of when and how the human to animal bond developed, not just to satisfy a craving for trivia, but because it says a lot about the evolution of human society.</p>

<p>People who have pets have free time and wealth, he says. Pets are animals that are kept for pleasure, and they have been tamed and domesticated. A domestic animal has also been tamed, and is kept by humans as a food source, for work, or only for pleasure. Not all domestic animals are pets, though they can bethink of a chicken, pig, or a cow. And not all tame animals are domestic.an elephant or a tiger, for instance.
One thing is certain: â€œWe know that dogs, without a doubt, were the first domestic animal, meaning that they were tamed and used for work or their fur or meat.  But its unclear if dogs were the first pets that is, kept solely for their companionship. So which animals were the first pet?The answer to that question is, nobody really knows.</p>
<p>The story of domestication and pets is not a linear progression from wild to domestic. Its more about how animals have taken on different roles in human society over the centuries. These things exist on a continuum  . Asking when the first pet came into being is a bit like asking when did life begin.</p>
<p>Humans have likely kept baby animals for amusement as long as humans have lived. But, usually, as those babies matured and became less cute and perhaps more unruly, they ended up being thrown back into the wild or maybe even eaten.

        In the sometimes-abusive relationship between people and dogs, the people are not always the violent ones. While a dog biting a person usually is not notable, there are circumstances so extreme and/or tragic that it becomes news. Sadly, dogs do occasionally maim or kill people (typically children).</p>

        <p> In some cases, stray dogs even form packs, terrorizing an area by attacking people, livestock, and pets.Unfortunately, a lot of stories about dogs are sad. By far the most common of these are the ones where a person does something terrible to a dog. Typical subjects include dog fighting rings, unethical breeders, random cruelty toward pets, and (gulp) bestiality. These stories succeed by generating tons of social media shares and comments, as dog lovers use all the online tools as their disposal to vent their spleen at the offender.

Dogs are also nice animals. On the good side, these types of stories can prompt thousands of people to line up to adopt a dog whos been rescued from an abusive situation.They provide security as most of know.They also act as pets to children mostly of youngstars.Dogs also save lives as much as they kill people through biting them.We have seen videos of dogs saving people from drawning from the ocean.Its high time we start looking at the positive side of having dogs as pets because we cant live a society without dogs.We should also learn how to treat dogs as part of us so that they can protect  us rather than biting us.
