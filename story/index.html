    <h2>I SHOULD HAVE</h2>
    <div class="img"><img src="img/one.jpg"></div>
    <p>We all know that chances come ones in a life time and we should embrace them without second guessing. There was a boy called Travis who was suffering from leukemia, he had lived his whole life inside the house being taken care of by his parents and siblings. 
One day he wanted to go outside, His mother was hesitant but reluctantly agreed. He was sick of always being at home and she knew that. So she let him go for a walk down the street.He walked past a lot of malls and came across a garden. He saw the prettiest girl he had ever seen and he knew immediately that he loved her. It was a case of love at first sight.He walked past a lot of malls and came across a garden. He saw the prettiest girl he had ever seen and he knew immediately that he loved her. It was a case of love at first sight.
He walked up to where she was selling flowers. He could not seem to notice anything else except her. She looked up at him and smiled. Can I help you? she asked in a magical voice ever. He just wanted to kiss her right then and there, but he managed to think of something as an excuse to talk to her.I, I want to buy flowers, he said. He picked up a random flower and paid the girl.
Would you like that wrapped and packed for you? she asked him, flashing him the cutest and blazing smile again.
He nodded, and she went to pack for him his order and came back. He took it and left

<p>To him just talking to her was heaven to him. He felt like he has met her queen. Being kept inside closed doors, he did not know how to approach a girl because the only ladies he got to see was his mum and sister. To his surprise he did not expect to ever fall in love because to him love was a no go zone because he new that his days were numbered on this earth.
The next day the boy went back and bought again flowers just to see her again, his order wrapped same as usual but this time he asked for her name and she told him that her name was Nadine. He really wanted to ask her out but he did not have the courage. The boy repeated the same thing for the next four months. He made it a routine 
</p>
<p>He put the flowers in his closet. His sister found out about this and asked him to just ask her out, so the next day when he went to buy the flowers, when Nadine went to get the wrapping paper, he wrote his number and left.
A few days later, she called him and the sister picked up. She wanted to speak to Travis. The sister (sobbing) told the girl that he had passed away last week.
Later, the sister wanted to remember her brother so she went to his room and opened his closet. There she found all the unopened packages of flowers. She opened one and it had a note. It was from  Nadine. Saying  Hi, I think you are really cute, do you want to go out?
She opened one more. There was one more piece of paper, and the same thing in the next pack and so on.

She thought to herself maybe if she had told him then maybe things would have been different. She could not accept that he was gone, she said to herself that if they did not get together in this life, maybe it was meant for them to be together in the afterlife so she killed herself. </p>
